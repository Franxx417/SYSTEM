# File Cleanup Summary - Duplicate po-create.js Removed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Two JavaScript files with similar names existed:
1. ❌ `resources/js/po-create.js` (old, incomplete)
2. ✅ `resources/js/pages/po-create.js` (new, complete with all features)

**Solution**: Removed the duplicate and kept the correct file.

- **Changed**: Removed line `'resources/js/po-create.js',` from input array
- **Result**: Build system now only references the correct file

### 3. Rebuilt Assets ✅
- **Command**: `npm run build`
- **Result**: Success! All assets compiled correctly
- **Output**: `po-create-D6B-d9PJ.js` (10.72 kB)
