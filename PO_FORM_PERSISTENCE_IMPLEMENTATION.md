# PO Form Data Persistence Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides intelligent form data persistence for the Create PO page that distinguishes between fresh form creation and page refreshes.

## Features

### 1. Fresh Form Creation
- **Behavior**: Form fields are empty when initially opened from Create buttons
- **Trigger**: When user clicks any "Create PO" or "New PO" button
- **Implementation**: Clears any existing draft data and starts with a clean form

### 2. Page Refresh Persistence
- **Behavior**: Previously entered data is restored when page is refreshed
- **Trigger**: When user refreshes the browser or navigates back to the form
- **Implementation**: Restores form data from localStorage if available

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Changes (`resources/js/pages/po-create.js`)

#### Key Functions Added:

1. **`generateSessionId()`**
   - Creates unique session identifier for each form creation session
   - Used to track whether form is fresh or being refreshed

2. **`isFreshFormCreation()`**
   - Detects if user is creating a new PO vs refreshing page
   - Checks for `?new=1` URL parameter
   - Validates session ID existence
   - Analyzes referrer information

3. **`initializeForm()`**
   - Main initialization function that determines form behavior
   - Clears draft for fresh creation
   - Restores data for page refreshes

#### Enhanced Data Persistence:

- **Storage Keys**:
  - `po_create_draft_v1`: Stores form data in localStorage
  - `po_create_session_id`: Tracks session ID in sessionStorage
  - `po_create_draft_v1_timestamp`: Tracks when draft was last updated

- **Data Saved**:
  - Supplier selection and manual supplier details
  - Purpose, dates, shipping, discount
  - All item rows with names, descriptions, quantities, and prices

### View Changes

#### Updated Create PO Links:
1. **`resources/views/dashboards/superadmin/tabs/pos.blade.php`**
   - "New PO" button now includes `?new=1` parameter

2. **`resources/views/dashboards/requestor.blade.php`**
   - "Create Purchase Order" button includes `?new=1` parameter

3. **`resources/views/po/index.blade.php`**
   - Create PO button includes `?new=1` parameter

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Creating New PO
1. User clicks "New PO" or "Create Purchase Order" button
2. Form loads completely empty
3. User enters data
4. Data is automatically saved to localStorage as user types

### Scenario 2: Page Refresh During Creation
1. User is filling out form
2. User accidentally refreshes page or browser crashes
3. Form reloads with all previously entered data intact
4. User can continue where they left off

### Scenario 3: Creating Another New PO
1. User completes a PO and wants to create another
2. User clicks "New PO" button again
3. Form loads empty, clearing previous draft
4. Fresh creation session begins

## Browser Storage Usage

- **localStorage**: Persistent across browser sessions, stores form draft data
- **sessionStorage**: Cleared when tab closes, stores session tracking
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Draft data is cleared on successful form submission

## Console Logging

The implementation includes console logging for debugging:
- "Fresh form creation - starting with empty form"
- "Page refresh detected - restoring form data"

## Benefits

1. **Data Safety**: Users won't lose work due to accidental refreshes
2. **Clean Start**: Each new PO creation begins with empty form
3. **Seamless UX**: Transparent to users, works automatically
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient storage usage
5. **Reliability**: Handles edge cases and browser differences

## Browser Compatibility

- Works with all modern browsers that support:
  - localStorage
  - sessionStorage
  - URLSearchParams
  - Modern JavaScript features (ES6+)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Fresh Creation Test**:
   - Click "New PO" button
   - Verify form is empty
   - Enter some data
   - Click "New PO" again
   - Verify form is empty again

2. **Refresh Persistence Test**:
   - Click "New PO" button
   - Enter form data
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Verify data is restored

3. **Cross-Tab Test**:
   - Open form in multiple tabs
   - Verify each behaves independently

4. **Submission Test**:
   - Fill form and submit
   - Click "New PO" again
   - Verify form is empty (draft cleared)
